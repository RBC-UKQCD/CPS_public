\section input What goes in

Here we look at how the user sets the properties of a CPS a computation.
Some of these properties are parameters of the physics or the algorithm;
others might determine how the application behaves.

There are some feature of CPS applications which are hard-wired  \e i.e they
cannot be changed (without a major rewrite of the code). These are discussed
in the \ref hardwired section.

Others can, in principle, be decided at run-time. For example, there is an 
integer parameter called DoArg::x_node_sites which needs to be given a value.
There appears to be, however, no general way in the CPS to supply an 
application with parameters at run-time, so you will have to write you own 
code to do this. Options could be read from the command line \e e.g. something 
like
\verbatim 
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv){

    DoArg doarg;
    doarg.x_node_sites = atoi(argv[1]);	
\endverbatim 
which is the sort of thing the GNU \c getopt 
http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/man_getopt.html
library was designed to do more flexibly.

Or the values could be stored in a file which your program reads and parses.

Alternatively you could supply these parameters with 
build-time variables (\#defines, for instance):
\verbatim
    #define X_NODE_SITES 12

    DoArg doarg;
    doarg.x_node_sites = X_NODE_SITES;	
\endverbatim
which seems no better than hard-wiring their values into
the code:
\verbatim
    DoArg doarg;
    doarg.x_node_sites = 12;
\endverbatim
but might have some advantage if all the \#defines were in a header file that 
was included in all your applications, thereby ensuring that they all are
built with the same parameters.

Alternatively we could end up with some sort of funky XML-defined interface.

Somehow, however, various parameters need to be given values.

\subsection runtimeinput Run-time options

A DoArg structure must be declared at the start of all CPS 
applications. This structure contains parameters which must be assigned 
values at the beginning of the program - 
note, however, that some of them (the more esoteric ones) are
automatically assigned default values.

Some of these parameters describe the geometry
of the lattice and how it is decomposed over the processor grid.

- The dimensions of the local lattice
 - DoArg::x_node_sites
 - DoArg::y_node_sites  
 - DoArg::z_node_sites  
 - DoArg::t_node_sites  
 .
These must always be assigned a value. 

- The dimensions of the processor grid
 - DoArg::x_nodes 
 - DoArg::y_nodes 
 - DoArg::z_nodes
 - DoArg::t_nodes
 .
These must always be assigned a value.


- Additional parameters for domain wall fermions
 - DoArg::s_node_sites This defaults to 1 but should be set to a greater value 
in a domain wall fermion application. 
 - DoArg::s_nodes  This defaults to 1 but can be set to a greater value 
in a domain wall fermion application. If it is one of the other grid 
dimensions must be 1 (the grid can not be more then four-dimensional - see 
section \ref griddecomp).
 - DoArg::s_axis This defines the grid direction in which the 5th direction is 
parallelised and so is ignored inless %Do_arg::s_nodes is assigned a value 
greter than 1. It cannot be a direction which is already parallel.
.
These can be safely ignored if domain wall fermions are not being used.

Others define the parameters of the  action and  the boundary conditions.

- The boundary conditions 
 - DoArg::x_bc
 - DoArg::y_bc
 - DoArg::z_bc
 - DoArg::t_bc
 .
These must be assigned a value.

- Gauge action parameter (see \ref gaugeactions)
 - DoArg::beta

- Tadpole improvement parameter
 - DoArg::u0        

- \ref powerplaq parameters
 - DoArg::power_plaq_cutoff
 - DoArg::power_plaq_exponent

- \ref powerrect parameters
 - DoArg::power_rect_cutoff
 - DoArg::power_rect_exponent 

- Anisotropic action parameters
 - DoArg::xi_bare
 - DoArg::xi_dir    
 - DoArg::xi_v    
 - DoArg::xi_v_xi 
 - DoArg::clover_coeff_xi
 - DoArg::xi_gfix        

- \ref dwaction parameters
 - DoArg::dwf_height 
 - DoArg::dwf_a5_inv 

- \ref cloveraction parameter
 - DoArg::clover_coeff

 Parameters of an action that is not used in an application do not need 
to be assigned a value - they are either ignored or take on reasonable 
defaults.

Some describe how the gauge field and RNG are to be started in this 
application:

- Gauge field initialisation 
 - DoArg::start_conf_kind Defines how the gauge field is to be initialised
 - DoArg::start_conf_load_addr The address in memory of the initial gauge field.
This is ignored if the gauge field is not initialised by already being stored 
in memory.

- RNG initialisation
 - DoArg::start_seed_kind Defines how the RNG is to be initialised
 - DoArg::start_seed_value An RNG seed. This is ignored if the RNG is not to be
 reseeded with a user-supplied seed.


When the members of the DoArg instance have been defined, it is used to
initialise a globally scoped GlobalJobParameter object named ::GJP (see also
\ref glob).
\verbatim
int main(int argc, char **argv){

    DoArg doarg;
    doarg.x_node_sites = atoi(argv[1]);	
	// etc. etc.
    GJP.Initialize(doarg);
\endverbatim

Other possible run-time options concern algorithmic parameters and properties:
These are described elsewhere (see \ref algopage).

Still other possible run-time options determine the behaviour of what is 
written out by the application. This is described in the section \ref output.

\subsection mpiscuin The MPI-SCU interface

The MPI-SCU layer, described in the \ref parallel section, emulates the system 
calls provided by the QCDOC operating system. 

User code does not to start the MPI-SCU
emulation directly; instead, it is started the first time a SCU system
call is made. For most CPS applications this will be when ::GJP is
initialised with GlobalJobParameters::Initialize.

Starting the MPI-SCU layer depends on how the run-time 
environment is set up. MPI-SCU checks whether 
the environment variable \c COMMS_DEF is defined. 
If defined, this environment variable can contain either the parameters  
which the MPI-SCU layer needs, the name of a file containing those 
parameters, or nothing at all.

The parameters themselves must be defined as a series of
tag and value pairs in the format \c {NAME=value} as follows:
- \c {GRID=t,x,y,z} Defines the dimensions of the processor drid in each
   direction. This must be defined.
- \c {LOGFILE=filename} If this is specified then log messages
   can be written to files called <tt>filename.</tt><i>nn</i> where <i>nn</i>
is the number of the node, left padded with zeros, from which the message 
is written. If its value is \c stderr or \c stdout that stream is used instead.
This is optional and defaults to \c stderr. Most messages are only logged if
\c MPISCU_DEBUG is defined at build time.
- \c {SEED=i} Defines an integer \c i to be used as the system-defined RNG 
seed. This is optional and defaults to 1.
- \c {SEEDFILE=filename}  Specifies a file containing 
   RNG seeds. This is optional and defaults to \c rng.dat.
.
I think the format is reasonably tolerant of whitespace.

These values can be written in a file which is read at
runtime, in which case the environment variable \c COMMS_DEF should be
given the name of the file,  
\e  e.g. 
\verbatim
export COMMS_DEF=mpi.par
\endverbatim
in bash, where the file \c mpi.par could contain something like
\verbatim
{ GRID=2,4,4,4}
{ LOGFILE=foo }
{ SEED=1234 }
\endverbatim

Alternatively the same information could be supplied by defining 
\c COMMS_DEF as
\verbatim
export COMMS_DEF={GRID=2,4,4,4}{LOGFILE=foo}{SEED=1234}
\endverbatim

If COMMS_DEF is defined but not given a value, MPI-SCU
looks for a parameter file with the default name \c commsMPI.def.

If COMMS_DEF is not defined, then MPI-SCU expects the 
the dimensions of the processor grid to have previously been
communicated to it \e via the function  ::MPISCU_set_pe_grid.

If MPI has not been started, then MPI-SCU starts MPI with a call to
MPI_Init. However,  
the CPS application or another library can safely start MPI before any
SCU system calls are made. 

The MPI-SCU initialisation function SCUCommsInit() will create a 
cartesian communicator based on the information supplied.

\subsection hardwired Hard-wired limitations/features

- Physical things
 - The number of colours is 3.
 - The number of spacetime dimensions is 4

- Algorithmic things
The implementations of the algorithms described in the section \ref algo
should be taken as being hardwired unless specified otherwise. 

The solver is CG with odd-even preconditioning.

\section output What comes out

To some extent this depends on what goes in.

\subsection message Information messages

When a program is running it is often useful to have it print messages
recording its progress. However, during code development, debugging and 
testing you might want all sorts of detailed information to be dumped that
you would not want during a normal production run.

The CPS code allows you to configure an application to write various messages 
to \c stdout in a controlled way. This is done through the Verbose class.
With this class various categories of messages are defined and each  category 
is given a number, defining a hierarchy of message categories. This hierarchy,
defined in the ::VerboseLevelType enumeration type, is

-# General warning messages.
-# Messages printing results
-# Messages describing dynamic memory management 
-# More messages describing to dynamic memory management 
-# Messages indicating function entry and exit
-# Messages describing progress through functions
-# Messages describing function arguments
-# Debugging messages
-# Messages printing the clock time on function entry and exit
-# Messages printing the clock time during progress through functions
-# Messages printing the clock time
-# LED control (presumably something specific to QCDSP)
-# Messages with information about the  RNG seed

You can tell the Verbose class which of these categories should be printed.
First, as described in the \ref glob section,
there should be a global instance of the Verbose class called ::VRB.

\verbatim
    Verbose VRB;
\endverbatim

The default behaviour of the Verbose class is to enable  message 
categories reporting results,
  function progress, clock output and RNG seed information.
One way  of
 enabling printing of a message category is to 
 set the verbosity level with the Verbose::Level(VerboseLevelType) method.
The argument it takes should be
one of the fields in the ::VerboseLevelType enumeration type. This enables 
the printing of messages with that category and those above it in the 
hierarchy.

For example, if we want messages of all categories up to and
including memory
allocation messages to be 
enabled we can look at the definition of ::VerboseLevelType where we see that 
::VERBOSE_SMALLOC_LEVEL is the level that turns on memory allocation messages.
Then call
\verbatim
    VRB.Level(VERBOSE_SMALLOC_LEVEL);
\endverbatim
This enables all messages of level 3 and below, i.e. memory allocation 
messages, "results" messages and "warning" messages.

The message level of VRB can be changed in this manner anywhere in the code
which is useful for enabling more detailed errors in just a specific part of 
the code. 

There is also a way to enable specific message types, rather than "all message
types up to and including this one" by calling Verbose::Activate_level
with an argument of type VerboseLevelType corresponding to the desired
message type. Similarly, a message category can be switched off by
calling Verbose::DeactivateLevel. Finally, the
Verbose::DeactivateAll method switches off all messages.

To see if a type of message is enabled, use the 
Verbose::IsEnabled(VerboseLevelType) method, which allows one to write, say
\verbatim
    if(VRB.IsEnabled(VERBOSE_DEBUG_LEVEL)){
	
	// Do lots of stuff that you only want to do for debugging purposes,
	int i = debug_info_only();

        // then write out the results
	VRB.Debug("The answer is %d ", i);
    }
\endverbatim

Alternatively, a method retained for backwards compatibility allows
one can do this by calling Verbose::Level with a negative 
argument of the form \a -level<sub>a</sub>level<sub>b</sub>level<sub>c</sub> where \a level<sub>i</sub> 
are two-digit numbers (left-padded with zero if necessary) corresponding to 
the desired message levels.

For example, suppose we want to enable function entry and exit messages, 
function argument messages and RNG seed messages. We have to look at the 
definition of ::VerboseLevelType where we see that the message levels we want
are ::VERBOSE_FUNC_LEVEL, ::VERBOSE_INPUT_LEVEL and ::VERBOSE_RNGSEED_LEVEL.
These have the numerical values of 4, 6 and 12 respectively. Therefore the 
argument to VRB::Level could be -040612:
\verbatim
    VRB.Level(-40612);
\endverbatim


\subsection doh Error messages

If something goes sufficiently wrong in the program that it cannot sensibly
continue executing we try to recognise the situation in the code and exit
gracefully with an informative error message which will, it is hoped, give
the user a hint as to what went wrong.

These error messages are handled by the Error class.
As described in the \ref glob section,
there should be a global instance of the Error class called ::ERR.

The methods of the Error class print messages for the following types of 
error before causing the program to exit:

- A pointer being unexpectedly uninitialised (-1)
- Failure to open a file for reading (-2)
- Failure to open a file for writing (-3)
- Failure to open a file for appending (-4)
- Calling a method which is only a stub and not fully implemented (-5)
- Hardware failure (-6)
- Miscellaneous error \e i.e. anything else (-7)

The numbers in parentheses are the exit codes.

The error messages are written to \c stdout and to a file called \c
phys.error.


\subsection outputdata Output data

The algorithms (see the \ref algo section) in general have the capacity to
log some data. You can control whether this is done and to where this data
is dumped.

The data is written to \c stdout if the ::VERBOSE_RESULT_LEVEL of the global 
Verbose class is enabled (see the \ref message section), \e e.g
\verbatim
    VRB.Level(VERBOSE_RESULT_LEVEL);
\endverbatim

The data can be written to a file using the CommonArg 
structure which is an argument of the base algorithm class constructor Alg,
from which all aglorithm classes inherit. For example,
to log the data in a file called \c run.log, we could write
\verbatim
    CommonArg common\_arg;
    common_arg.set_filename("run.log");
\endverbatim

\section fileformat Filestore interface 

File formats for gauge configurations \&c.


\section stdout Writing to files and standard output

QCDSP was designed so that when the \e printf and \e fprintf
functions were called only one node (node 0) actually wrote data to 
\c stdout or the file.
To maintain backwards compatibility,
the CPS mimics this behaviour on all platforms by altering the standard 
behaviour of these functions so that only one node writes.

In addition there are special functions which implement the functionality
of \e printf and \e fprintf on all nodes. These are
- ::qprintf_all
- ::qfprintf_all
- ::qprintf_allid

These functions cause data to be written from all nodes. The last function 
prefixes each written string with a node ID and the grid coordinates of the 
node.
